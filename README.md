# AI Domain Name Generator LLM - FamilyWall AI Engineer Homework

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for domain name generation. It highlights systematic evaluation, edge case discovery, iterative improvement, and production deployment.  
Developed as part of the FamilyWall AI Engineer assignment, the project reflects advanced ML engineering practices with a strong focus on reproducibility and clarity.

## What I Built
**Core Achievement:** Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct using LoRA techniques to generate creative, relevant domain names from business descriptions.  
The evaluation framework shows the methodology, while results are illustrative due to the intentionally small dataset.

## Journey and Challenges
This project was the outcome of several iterations and experiments:

1. **Initial Trials**
   - Experimented with GPT-2 and smaller models to test feasibility.
   - Faced limitations in model quality, lack of relevant outputs, and instability during training.

2. **Mistral Experiments**
   - Attempted fine-tuning with Mistral-7B.
   - Hit computational and memory challenges that were not feasible with limited resources.

3. **Final Decision**
   - Settled on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct for balance between feasibility, quality, and compatibility.
   - Applied LoRA fine-tuning, reducing trainable parameters to just 0.12% of the base model.
   - Enabled efficient experimentation within resource constraints while maintaining reasonable quality.

Through this process, I managed to build a working pipeline despite hardware, dataset, and stability challenges.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

- **Resource Constraints**: Due to limited hardware (9GB memory, no high-end GPU), only small-scale LoRA fine-tuning was executed. Full-scale iterations were not feasible in this environment.  
- **Planned Iterations (Not Executed)**: Dataset augmentation, prompt engineering, and further hyperparameter tuning. These steps are documented in the methodology but not executed due to constraints.  
- **Reproducibility**: The pipeline and scripts are complete, enabling anyone with sufficient compute resources to reproduce and extend the experiments.
