# Model Card for Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct Domain Name Generator

## Model Description

This is a LoRA fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, specifically adapted for generating creative and relevant domain names from business descriptions. The model uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve task-specific improvements while maintaining the base model's general capabilities.

- **Developed by:** Mugesh Murugaiyan (FamilyWall AI Engineer Homework)
- **Model type:** LoRA fine-tuned text generation model
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** Same as base model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct license)
- **Finetuned from model:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (3.1B parameters)

## Uses

### Direct Use

This model is designed to generate domain name suggestions for businesses based on text descriptions. It can be used in:

- Domain name suggestion tools
- Business naming services
- Creative writing assistance
- Brand development tools

### Downstream Use

The model can be further fine-tuned for:
- Other naming tasks (product names, company names)
- Creative text generation
- Business description summarization

### Out-of-Scope Use

- Not suitable for general conversation
- Not designed for code generation
- Not intended for factual question answering
- Should not be used for generating inappropriate content

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Limitations

- **Small training dataset:** Only 15 synthetic examples
- **Domain specificity:** Optimized for business domain names
- **Evaluation scope:** Limited to demonstration purposes
- **Generalization:** May not perform well on unrelated tasks

### Recommendations

Users should:
- Validate generated domain names for trademark conflicts
- Test outputs for appropriateness in their context
- Consider the model's training limitations
- Use as a creative starting point, not final decision

## How to Get Started with the Model

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./qwen2.5-3b-instruct")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./qwen2.5-3b-instruct")

# Load LoRA adapters
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, "./fine_tuned_model_stable_backup")

# Generate domain names
prompt = "Generate domain names for: organic coffee shop"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
